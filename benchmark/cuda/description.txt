test1:
Pin memory on one process and do computation in another process.
Result: pinning memory does not affect operations in other processes.

test2:
Pin memory on one thread and do computation in another thread.
Result: pinning memory does affect operations in other threads.

test3:
Pin memory on one process and do transmission in another process.
Result: pinning memory does not take effect for transmission in other processes.
